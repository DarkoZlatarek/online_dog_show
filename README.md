# [Online Dog Show](#online-dog-show)
Online dog show is a page where users can post the photo of their dog/s and see other people's photos of dogs. Users can like other posts. Interacting with each other is possible through comments on their posts. There is a little harmless competition between users. The most liked photo is displayed on its own. There is no reward apart from ego boost.
